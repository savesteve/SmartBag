        <h3>SmartBag - A World of Warcraft Addon by Wiefu of Muradin</h3>

<p>SmarBag is an addon ment to help you keep your inventory organized. It does this by automatically moving items into bags for you. What it moves and where it moves it to is up to you. After downloading the addon once you login for the first time you'll see the SmartBag configuration screen. Simply pick what bag you'd like your gear sorted into and wether or not you'd like to automatically sell useless grey items when you open a vendor. That's it! You don't have to think about moving your gear around in your bags ever again!
</p>

<p>You can always call up the setting window again if you want to change anything with the slash commands:</p>
<pre><code>/sb
or 
/smartbag
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Sorting happens whenever you leave combat or open a vendor. There are no messages when you leave combat that sorting has happened. I felt it was too spammy. I might add an option for leave combat messages at some point if people request it enough.</p>

Thanks for looking/downloading my addon, I'd love any feedback you may have.
